Style this table with an alternating background colour of #F8F9F8 and black text for even rows.

All odd rows should have a background colour of #5A595A with white text.

For the action column there will be two functions 
1. [Edit] which will need to represented as an anchor tag that when clicked must display an alert to the user stating " You are editing [Student Name]" where "Student Name" is replaced with the selected row's student name.

2. [Delete] which will need to represented as an anchor tag that when clicked must display an confirmation dialog asking the user "Do you really want to delete [Student Name]" where "Student Name" is the selected row's student name. The user MUST type Yes to delete the row. If confirmation passes the selected row must be removed from the document, if No is clicked nothing should happen
